(note: everything little endian)
(note: "NString" = 4 bytes length, then that many 8 bit characters to form a string)

4 bytes - level width
4 bytes - level height
4 bytes - number of tiles used
number of tiles used NStrings - names of tiles used (no extension or "tiles/" prefix), sorted alphabettically - appear once maximum - indexes of these will be used later
4 bytes - number of layers in the level
for each layer:
	4 bytes - number of tiles in this layer
	4 bytes - tile index (0 based, tiles as they appear above)
	4 bytes - tile x position (integer)
	4 bytes - tile y position (integer)
4 bytes - number of platforms
for each platform:
	4 bytes - number of "vertices" on the platform (connected lines)
	for each vertex:
		4 bytes - vertex x position (integer)
		4 bytes - vertex y position (integer)
